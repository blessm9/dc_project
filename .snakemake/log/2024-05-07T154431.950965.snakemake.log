MissingOutputException in rule create_docker_images_notebook_executor in file Z:\projects\dc_project\Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 10 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
00-Utils/Docker-ipnyb-execution/image/notebook-executor.tar (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
