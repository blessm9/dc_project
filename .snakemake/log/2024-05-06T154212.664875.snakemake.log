Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule create_database in file Z:\projects\dc_project\Snakefile, line 5:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
02 - Data Curation/unified.db (missing locally, parent dir contents: DB creation.ipynb, DB curation.ipynb, invalid_sequences.xlsx)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
